# Installation

Get started with FormSCN in your Next.js or React project.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

- Node.js 18+ installed
- A React or Next.js project
- pnpm, npm, or yarn package manager

## Install Dependencies

The easiest way to get started is using the **Form Builder** to generate a custom installation command.

However, if you want to set up a project manually, ensure you have the standard **shadcn/ui** dependencies installed.

## Install shadcn/ui

FormSCN forms are built on top of shadcn/ui. If you haven't already, initialize it:

```bash
npx shadcn@latest init
```

## Add Base Components

Our generated forms typically rely on these standard components. You can install them ahead of time:

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add form input button label textarea card select checkbox radio-group
```

## TypeScript Configuration

Ensure your `tsconfig.json` has the following settings (standard for shadcn projects):

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "strict": true,
    "esModuleInterop": true,
    "skipLibCheck": true,
    "paths": {
      "@/*": ["./src/*"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Next Steps

Now that you have FormSCN installed, check out the [Quick Start](/docs/quick-start) guide to build your first form.
