# Quick Start

Get up and running with FormsCN in seconds.

## 1. Choose a Template

Browse our [Templates Gallery](/templates) or start from scratch in the [Visual Editor](/editor).

## 2. Install via CLI

Run the installation command in your terminal. This will install the form component and all necessary dependencies (Zod, React Hook Form, UI components) directly into your project.

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add https://formscn.space/r/contact-form.json
```

## 3. Use the Component

Import and use the form in your page.

```tsx
import { ContactForm } from "@/components/contact-form"

export default function Page() {
  return (
    <div className="max-w-md mx-auto py-10">
      <ContactForm />
    </div>
  )
}
```

## Customizing

All forms are fully type-safe and owned by you. You can modify the Zod schema or UI components directly in `components/contact-form.tsx`.
