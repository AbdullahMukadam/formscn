# Open Source & Contributing

FormCN is community-driven. We'd love your help to make form building easier for everyone.

## Getting Started

### 1. Setup the Project

FormCN is a monorepo managed by Turborepo.

1.  **Fork & Clone**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/AbdullahMukadam/formscn.git
    cd formcn
    ```
2.  **Install Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pnpm install
    ```
3.  **Run Development Server**:
    ```bash
    pnpm dev
    ```
    This starts the web app at `http://localhost:3001`.

## Project Structure

*   `apps/web`: The main Next.js application containing the visual builder, documentation, and the registry source.
*   `apps/web/src/registry/default`: The core of the registry.
    *   `templates/`: Definition files for form templates (e.g., `login.ts`, `onboarding-wizard.ts`).
    *   `lib/form-generator.ts`: The logic that generates code from templates.
    *   `ui/`: Reusable UI components used within templates.

## Roadmap & Areas for Contribution

We are actively looking for help with:

*   **Conditional Logic**: Adding `if/then` branching to the visual builder and schema generator.
*   **Drag-and-Drop Step Reordering**: Improving the UX for multi-step form management.
*   **AI Integration**: Generating form schemas from text prompts.
*   **New Templates**: Adding more complex real-world forms (e.g., KYC, Medical Intake).

## Common Tasks

### Adding a New Template

The easiest way to contribute a new template is to build it visually first.

1.  **Build Visually**:
    Open the [Visual Builder](http://localhost:3001/editor) locally. Build your form (fields, steps, validation).

2.  **Export Configuration**:
    Use the developer tools or console to inspect the form state, or look at how `useFormEditor` saves the state. We are working on a "Export to JSON" feature for contributors.
    
    *Currently, you can manually create the template definition file based on your design.*

3.  **Create Template File**:
    Create a new file in `apps/web/src/registry/default/templates/` (e.g., `medical-intake.ts`).
    
    ```ts
    import type { FormTemplate } from "../types";

    export const medicalIntake: FormTemplate = {
      id: "medical-intake",
      name: "Medical Intake",
      description: "Patient registration and medical history.",
      fields: [
         // ... your fields here
      ],
    };
    ```

4.  **Register the Template**:
    Add it to `apps/web/src/registry/default/templates/index.ts`.

5.  **Build Registry**:
    Run `pnpm --filter web registry:build` to generate the artifacts.

### Improving the Generator

If you want to improve the code generation logic (e.g., better validation support, new UI frameworks):

1.  Edit `apps/web/src/registry/default/lib/form-generator.ts`.
2.  Test your changes by running the visual builder and checking the "Code" tab.
3.  Run `pnpm --filter web registry:build` to update the generator artifacts.

## Submitting Changes

1.  Create a branch for your feature (`git checkout -b feature/amazing-form`).
2.  Commit your changes.
3.  Push to your fork and submit a Pull Request.

We appreciate all contributions!
