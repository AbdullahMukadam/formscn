# Open Source & Contributing

FormSCN is community-driven. We'd love your help to make form building easier for everyone.

## Getting Started

### 1. Setup the Project

FormSCN is a monorepo managed by Turborepo.

1.  **Fork & Clone**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/AbdullahMukadam/formscn.git
    cd formcn
    ```
2.  **Install Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pnpm install
    ```
3.  **Run Development Server**:
    ```bash
    pnpm dev
    ```
    This starts the web app at `http://localhost:3001`.

## Project Structure

- `apps/web`: The main Next.js application containing the visual builder, documentation, and the registry source.
- `apps/web/src/registry/default`: The core of the registry.
  - `templates/`: Definition files for form templates (e.g., `login.ts`, `onboarding-wizard.ts`)
  - `lib/form-generator/`: Code generation logic for React Hook Form and TanStack Form
  - `ui/`: Reusable UI components used within templates

## Current Features

FormSCN now supports:
- **React Hook Form** and **TanStack Form** code generation
- **shadcn Dependencies Detection** - auto-detect required components
- **Optional Better Auth** - auth features are completely optional
- **Form Library Selector** - toggle between RHF and TanStack in the editor
- **Welcome Modal** - onboarding for first-time users
- **20+ Templates** - categorized by use case

## Roadmap & Areas for Contribution

We are actively looking for help with:

- **Conditional Logic**: Adding `if/then` branching to the visual builder and schema generator
- **Drag-and-Drop Step Reordering**: Improving the UX for multi-step form management
- **AI Integration**: Generating form schemas from text prompts
- **New Templates**: Adding more complex real-world forms (e.g., KYC, Medical Intake, Survey Forms)
- **New Field Types**: File upload improvements, rich text editor, phone input with country codes
- **Validation Enhancements**: Cross-field validation, custom validation rules
- **Theme System**: More theme presets and customization options
- **Framework Support**: SolidStart, SvelteKit generators

## Common Tasks

### Adding a New Template

The easiest way to contribute a new template is to build it visually first.

1.  **Build Visually**:
    Open the [Visual Builder](http://localhost:3001/editor) locally. Build your form (fields, steps, validation).

2.  **Export Configuration**:
    Use the developer tools or console to inspect the form state, or look at how `useFormEditor` saves the state. We are working on a "Export to JSON" feature for contributors.
    
    *Currently, you can manually create the template definition file based on your design.*

3.  **Create Template File**:
    Create a new file in `apps/web/src/registry/default/templates/` (e.g., `medical-intake.ts`).
    
    ```ts
    import type { FormTemplate } from "../types";

    export const medicalIntake: FormTemplate = {
      id: "medical-intake",
      name: "Medical Intake",
      description: "Patient registration and medical history form.",
      category: "healthcare", // authentication | contact | ecommerce | profile
      fields: [
         // ... your fields here
      ],
      // Auth is optional - only add if your template needs it
      // oauthProviders: [],
      // authPlugins: {},
    };
    ```

4.  **Register the Template**:
    Add it to `apps/web/src/registry/default/templates/index.ts`.

5.  **Build Registry**:
    Run `pnpm --filter web registry:build` to generate the artifacts.

### Improving the Generator

If you want to improve the code generation logic:

**For React Hook Form:**
1. Edit files in `apps/web/src/registry/default/lib/form-generator/generators/`
2. Test your changes by running the visual builder and checking the "Code" tab
3. Run `pnpm --filter web registry:build` to update the generator artifacts

**For TanStack Form:**
1. Edit files in `apps/web/src/registry/default/lib/form-generator/generators/tanstack/`
2. Both generators should produce equivalent functionality

### Adding a New Field Type

1. Add the field configuration to `apps/web/src/lib/form-fields-config.ts`
2. Update the generator to handle the new field type
3. Add the field to the form builder sidebar
4. Test in both RHF and TanStack Form modes

## Code Style

- **TypeScript**: All code must be type-safe
- **shadcn/ui**: Use standard shadcn components
- **Accessibility**: Ensure keyboard navigation and screen reader support
- **Comments**: Add JSDoc for public APIs

## Submitting Changes

1. Create a branch for your feature (`git checkout -b feature/amazing-form`)
2. Commit your changes with clear messages
3. Push to your fork and submit a Pull Request
4. Include screenshots/videos for UI changes
