# Introduction

Welcome to FormSCN documentation. FormSCN is the **visual form builder for shadcn/ui**—helping you create beautiful, accessible forms with drag-and-drop simplicity.

## What is FormSCN?

FormSCN is an open-source tool that lets you:
- **Design forms visually** with a drag-and-drop editor
- **Generate production-ready code** using shadcn/ui components
- **Choose your form library**: React Hook Form or TanStack Form
- **Add auth optionally** via Better Auth (OAuth, 2FA, Magic Links, etc.)
- **Export or install** via CLI with one command

## Core Features

### Visual Form Builder
Build forms visually without writing code. See live preview as you design.

### shadcn/ui Components
Every form uses your existing shadcn/ui components (Button, Input, Select, etc.). No learning curve.

### Choose Your Form Library
Toggle between:
- **React Hook Form** (industry standard)
- **TanStack Form** (modern, headless)

Same visual builder, different output—you own the code.

### shadcn Dependencies Detection
Automatically detects which shadcn components your form needs and provides the installation command.

### Optional Better Auth
Add authentication features when you need them:
- OAuth providers (Google, GitHub, etc.)
- Email/Password authentication
- Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)
- Magic Links
- Passkeys
- Organizations

**Auth is completely optional**—use it only when you need it.

### Framework Support
Generate code for:
- **Next.js** (App Router & Pages Router)
- **Vite/React**
- **TanStack Start**
- **Remix**

### Type-Safe by Default
Full TypeScript support with auto-generated Zod schemas.

### CLI Integration
Install forms directly with:
```bash
npx shadcn@latest add https://formscn.com/api/r/YOUR_FORM_ID.json
```

## Available Templates

FormSCN comes with **20+ pre-built templates** organized by category:

- **Authentication**: Login, Signup, Password Reset, Change Password (all auth-optional)
- **Organization**: Invitations, Team Management
- **Multi-Step Wizards**: Onboarding, Detailed Applications
- **E-commerce**: Checkout forms
- **Contact & Support**: Contact forms, Support Tickets, Booking Requests
- **Profile**: Settings, Address forms
- **Marketing**: Waitlist, Newsletter, Event Registration

## Getting Started

The fastest way to use FormSCN is the **Visual Builder**:

1. Go to the [Form Builder](/editor)
2. Choose a template or start from scratch
3. Customize your form (add fields, validation, optional auth)
4. Select your preferred form library (RHF or TanStack)
5. Publish and get your unique `shadcn add` command
6. Install and use!

Or check out the [Quick Start](/docs/quick-start) guide for step-by-step instructions.

## Quick Example

```tsx
import { useForm } from "react-hook-form";
import { zodResolver } from "@hookform/resolvers/zod";
import * as z from "zod";

const schema = z.object({
  email: z.string().email(),
  password: z.string().min(8),
});

export default function LoginForm() {
  const form = useForm({
    resolver: zodResolver(schema),
  });

  return (
    <form onSubmit={form.handleSubmit((data) => console.log(data))}>
      {/* Form fields */}
    </form>
  );
}
```
