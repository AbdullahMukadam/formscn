## Getting Started

The most powerful way to use FormSCN is via the **Visual Builder**:

1.  Go to the [Form Builder](/editor).
2.  Customize your form (add fields, auth, validation).
3.  Publish and get your unique `shadcn add` command.

Alternatively, you can install the base components manually:

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add @formscn/base-form
```

Or check out the [Installation](/docs/installation) guide for manual setup.

## Quick Example

```tsx
import { useForm } from "react-hook-form";
import { zodResolver } from "@hookform/resolvers/zod";
import * as z from "zod";

const schema = z.object({
  email: z.string().email(),
  password: z.string().min(8),
});

export default function LoginForm() {
  const form = useForm({
    resolver: zodResolver(schema),
  });

  return (
    <form onSubmit={form.handleSubmit((data) => console.log(data))}>
      {/* Form fields */}
    </form>
  );
}
```
