# Introduction

Welcome to FormCN documentation. FormCN is a powerful **Open Source** form building library that helps you create beautiful, accessible forms with minimal effort.

## Features

- **Pre-built Components**: Ready-to-use form components built with shadcn/ui
- **CLI Integration**: Install components directly with `shadcn add`
- **Better Auth Integrated**: Full authentication support (OAuth, Email/Password) out of the box
- **Framework Agnostic**: Generate code for Next.js, Vite, TanStack Start, and Remix
- **Type-Safe**: Full TypeScript support with React Hook Form and Zod
- **Visual Editor**: Customize forms visually and get a unique CLI install command
- **Every Form is Editable**: You own the code. No vendor lock-in.
- **Accessible**: Built with accessibility in mind using Base UI primitives
- **Open Source**: MIT Licensed and community-driven

## Getting Started

The most powerful way to use FormCN is via the **Visual Builder**:

1.  Go to the [Form Builder](/editor).
2.  Customize your form (add fields, auth, validation).
3.  Publish and get your unique `shadcn add` command.

Alternatively, you can install the base components manually:

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add @formscn/base-form
```

Or check out the [Installation](/docs/installation) guide for manual setup.

## Quick Example

```tsx
import { useForm } from "react-hook-form";
import { zodResolver } from "@hookform/resolvers/zod";
import * as z from "zod";

const schema = z.object({
  email: z.string().email(),
  password: z.string().min(8),
});

export default function LoginForm() {
  const form = useForm({
    resolver: zodResolver(schema),
  });

  return (
    <form onSubmit={form.handleSubmit((data) => console.log(data))}>
      {/* Form fields */}
    </form>
  );
}
```
