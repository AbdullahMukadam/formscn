# CLI Integration

FormCN leverages the standard `shadcn` CLI to install your custom-built forms.

## How it Works

Instead of installing a generic package, you build your form in our **Visual Editor**, publish it, and get a unique installation URL.

### 1. Build & Publish

Create your form in the [Form Builder](/editor). When you're ready, click **Integrate** -> **Publish**.

### 2. Install

Run the command provided by the editor:

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add http://formcn.com/api/r/your-form-id
```

This command will:
1.  **Download** the React component code for your specific form.
2.  **Install** necessary dependencies (`zod`, `react-hook-form`, `better-auth`, etc.).
3.  **Configure** your project (if using Auth/DB features).

## Why this approach?

- **No Black Box**: You get the full source code (`.tsx`) in your project.
- **Customizable**: You can edit the installed component just like any other file.
- **Framework Agnostic**: Works with Next.js, Vite, Remix, and TanStack Start.

## Standard Components

If you just want the standard shadcn UI components (Input, Button, etc.) without a pre-built form structure, use the standard shadcn registry:

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add input button label textarea
```
